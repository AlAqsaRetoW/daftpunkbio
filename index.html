                Biography
            </h2>
            <p>
                Daft Punk was a French electronic music duo formed in 1993 in Paris by Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel
                de Homem-Christo. The two met in 1987 while attending school in Paris and initially formed an indie rock
                band called Darlin' with a third member.
                After Darlin' disbanded, they shifted their focus to electronic music, adopting the name Daft Punk from
                a negative review of their earlier work. They became pioneers of the French house movement, blending
                house music with funk, disco, techno, rock,
                and synth-pop. Known for their iconic robot personas, they wore helmets, gloves, and futuristic outfits
                to conceal their identities, maintaining a mysterious public image throughout their career.

                Journey
            </h2>
            <p>
                Daft Punk's debut album, Homework (1997), featuring hits like "Around the World" and "Da Funk,"
                established them as leaders in electronic music. Their second album, Discovery (2001), included global
                successes such as "One More Time" and "Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger," and inspired the animated film
                Interstella 5555. Their third album, Human After All (2005), received mixed reviews but produced popular
                tracks like "Robot Rock." They directed the avant-garde film Electroma (2006) and gained widespread
                acclaim for their Alive 2007 tour and live album, which won a Grammy.

                In 2010, they composed the score for Tron: Legacy. Their fourth and final album, Random Access Memories
                (2013), marked a shift to live instrumentation and featured the global hit "Get Lucky," earning five
                Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year. They also collaborated with The Weeknd on the chart-topping
                "Starboy" (2016). Daft Punk announced their split in 2021, leaving behind a legacy as one of the most
                influential acts in dance and electronic music. Their albums Discovery and Random Access Memories were
                included in Rolling Stone's list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.
